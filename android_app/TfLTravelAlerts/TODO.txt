GENERAL:
========
- I don't like that there are three different objects for ConfiguredAlarms: the data class, the
entity and the "UI" class that is mutable (and has more fields)

Main/Initial Screen:
====================
- The code is a mess. Rewrite it in someway that looks better
- actually get data from server


Configured Alarms List (main screen):
====================================
- needs to update when the data changes


Alert details using MVI:
========================

- [done] implement time selection
    - could try to "connect" the click event on time view to showing the fragment with a rx stream
- add a delete icon to the toolbar
    - maybe a delete button too
- the clock icon set as startDrawable will CRASH older android version
- handle tearing down the rx streams (activity on pause/stop/destroy)



MUST DO BEFORE RELEASE:
=======================
- layout in older android versions looks wrong
    - not getting compat version of switch view
    - spacing is wrong
- migrate alarms from previous version
- implement push notifications


COULD DO:
=========
- option to be always up to date with the line status
- add support for Tfl Rail and TRAM lines
- double check order of lines
- in the network status views, collapse lines with good status
